<h3 class="center">(1785-1851)</h3>


<p>Mr. Noah was born in Philadelphia, July 19, 1785, the son of
Portuguese Jewish descent, it being stated by some sources that
his father not only fought in the Revolutionary Army, but was a
sufficient friend of George Washington to have the latter attend
his wedding. In his early years, he was apprenticed, according to
the custom of the day, to a carver and gilder, but he spent most
of his evenings in the Franklin Library and at the theatre, likewise
attending school in his spare time, where, among the pupils, he
met John and Steven Decatur, famed afterwards in the history of
the American Navy. He filled a minor position in the Auditor's
office in Philadelphia, but his tastes inclined more to journalistic
than they did to desk work, and, in 1800, he travelled to Harrisburg
as a political reporter.</p>

<p>Several years after this, he went to Charleston, and studied law,
but before he had had a chance to practise, he became the editor
of the Charleston <i>City Gazette</i>, and, advocating those principles
which resulted in the War of 1812, he used his pen, under the
pseudonym of <i>Muley Molack</i>, to disseminate those ideas in editorials.
The consequence is he encouraged much hatred, and was
forced into many duels to support his opinions. In 1811, he was
offered the position of Consul at Riga by President Madison, but
declined. In 1813, he was sent by Mr. Monroe, as Consul, to
Tunis, at a time when the United States was having trouble with
Algerian piracy.</p>

<p>During all this period, his pen was actively busy, and while he
was abroad he did much travelling which resulted, in 1819, in his
publishing a book of travels.</p>

<p>In 1816, he returned to New York, and settled there as a
journalist. Being a Tammanyite in politics, we find him filling
the position of Sheriff, Judge and Surveyor of the Port at various
periods. He was, likewise, an editor of some skill, and his name is
associated with the columns of the <i>New York Enquirer</i>, the
<i>Evening Star</i>, the <i>Commercial Advertiser</i>, the <i>Union</i>, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span><i>Times and Messenger</i>.</p>

<p>His political career may be measured in the following manner:</p>

<p>In 1821 he became Sheriff. In 1823, he was admitted to the bar
of New York, and in 1829 to the bar of the Supreme Court of the
United States. This same year he was appointed Surveyor of the
Port of New York.</p>

<p>Entering very prominently in politics, he opposed the election
of Van Buren, and gave his vote to General Harrison. Governor
Seward appointed him, in 1841, Judge of the Court of Sessions.
The same year he was made a Supreme Court Commissioner.</p>

<p>It was in 1825 that, as one of the early Zionists of America,
he entered into negotiations for the purchase of nearly three
thousand acres of land on Grand Island, in New York State,
where it was his dream to establish the City of Ararat, a haven
of Judaism in this country. This venture became the basis for a
story by Israel Zangwill, called "Noah's Ark." He died in New
York on March 22, 1851, having lived in that city since 1813.</p>

<p>Any full Bibliography will give a sufficient idea of the scope of
Major Noah's pen. He lived at a time when American Letters
were beginning to develop, himself a friend of most of the literary
figures of the day&mdash;Cooper, Irving, Fitz-Green Halleck and
others. And we have an excellent impression of the manner in
which the younger literary men regarded the authority of Noah
in the "Reminiscences" of J. T. Trowbridge:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Come with me," he [Mr. Noah] said, putting on his hat; and
we went out together, I with my roll of manuscript, he with his
stout cane. Even if I had been unaware of the fact, I should very
soon have discovered that I was in company with an important
personage. Everybody observed him, and it seemed as if every
third or fourth man we met gave him a respectful salute. He
continued his friendly talk with me in a way that relieved me of
all sense of my own insignificance in the shadow of his celebrity
and august proportions.</p></div>

<p>As far as his theatrical association is concerned, we can have
no better source of information than a letter written by Noah to
William Dunlap, and published in the latter's "History of the
American Theatre." It is quoted in full:</p>

<div class="blockquot gap2">
<p class="ralign">New-York, July 11, 1832.</p>

<p>To William Dunlap, Esq.,</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I am happy to hear that your work on the American Drama is in
press, and trust that you may realize from it that harvest of fame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span>
and money to which your untiring industry and diversified labours
give you an eminent claim. You desire me to furnish you a list of
my dramatic productions; it will, my dear sir, constitute a sorry
link in the chain of American writers&mdash;my plays have all been <i>ad
captandum</i>: a kind of <i>amateur</i> performance, with no claim to the
character of a settled, regular, or domiciliated writer for the green-room&mdash;a
sort of volunteer supernumerary&mdash;a dramatic writer by
"particular desire, and for this night only," as they say in the bills
of the play; my "line," as you well know, has been in the more
rugged paths of politics, a line in which there is more fact than
poetry, more feeling than fiction; in which, to be sure, there are
"exits and entrances"&mdash;where the "prompter's whistle" is constantly
heard in the voice of the people; but which, in our popular government,
almost disqualifies us for the more soft and agreeable translation
to the lofty conceptions of tragedy, the pure diction of genteel
comedy, or the wit, gaiety, and humour of broad farce.</p>

<p>I had an early hankering for the national drama, a kind of juvenile
patriotism, which burst forth, for the first time, in a few sorry
doggerels in the form of a prologue to a play, which a Thespian company,
of which I was a member, produced in the South-Street
Theatre&mdash;the old American Theatre in Philadelphia. The idea was
probably suggested by the sign of the Federal Convention at the
tavern opposite the theatre. You, no doubt, remember the picture
and the motto: an excellent piece of painting of the kind, representing
a group of venerable personages engaged in public discussions,
with the following distich:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"These thirty-eight great men have signed a powerful deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That better times, to us, shall very soon succeed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sign must have been painted soon after the adoption of the
Federation Constitution, and I remember to have stood "many a
time and oft," gazing, when a boy, at the assembled patriots, particularly
the venerable head and spectacles of Dr. Franklin, always
in conspicuous relief. In our Thespian corps, the honour of cutting
the plays, substituting new passages, casting parts, and writing
couplets at the exits, was divided between myself and a fellow of
infinite wit and humour, by the name of Helmbold; who subsequently
became the editor of a scandalous little paper, called <i>The
Tickler</i>: He was a rare rascal, perpetrated all kind of calumnies,
was constantly mulcted in fines, sometimes imprisoned, was full of
faults, which were forgotten in his conversational qualities and dry
sallies of genuine wit, particularly his Dutch stories. After years of
singular vicissitudes, Helmbold joined the army as a common
soldier, fought bravely during the late war, obtained a commission,
and died. Our little company soon dwindled away; the expenses
were too heavy for our pockets; our writings and performances were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span>
sufficiently wretched, but as the audience was admitted without cost,
they were too polite to express any disapprobation. We recorded
all our doings in a little weekly paper, published, I believe, by Jemmy
Riddle, at the corner of Chestnut and Third-Street, opposite the
tavern kept by that sturdy old democrat, Israel Israel.</p>

<p>From a boy, I was a regular attendant of the Chestnut-Street
Theatre, during the management of Wignell and Reinagle, and made
great efforts to compass the purchase of a season ticket, which I
obtained generally of the treasurer, George Davis, for eighteen
dollars. Our habits through life are frequently governed and
directed by our early steps. I seldom missed a night; and always
retired to bed, after witnessing a good play, gratified and improved:
and thus, probably, escaped the haunts of taverns, and the pursuits
of depraved pleasures, which too frequently allure and destroy our
young men; hence I was always the firm friend of the drama, and
had an undoubted right to oppose my example through life to the
horror and hostility expressed by sectarians to plays and play-houses
generally. Independent of several of your plays which had obtained
possession of the stage, and were duly incorporated in the legitimate
drama, the first call to support the productions of a fellow townsman,
was, I think, Barker's opera of <i>The Indian Princess</i>. Charles Ingersoll
had previously written a tragedy, a very able production for a
very young man, which was supported by all the "good society;"
but Barker, who was "one of us," an amiable and intelligent young
fellow, who owed nothing to hereditary rank, though his father was
a Whig, and a soldier of the Revolution, was in reality a fine spirited
poet, a patriotic ode writer, and finally a gallant soldier of the late
war. The managers gave Barker an excellent chance with all his
plays, and he had merit and popularity to give them in return full
houses.</p>

<p>About this time, I ventured to attempt a little melo-drama, under
the title of "The Fortress of Sorrento" [1808], which, not having
money enough to pay for printing, nor sufficient influence to have
acted, I thrust the manuscript in my pocket, and, having occasion
to visit New-York, I called in at David Longworth's Dramatic
Repository one day, spoke of the little piece, and struck a bargain
with him, by giving him the manuscript in return for a copy of every
play he had published, which at once furnished me with a tolerably
large dramatic collection. I believe the play never was performed,
and I was almost ashamed to own it; but it was my first regular
attempt at dramatic composition.</p>

<p>In the year 1812, while in Charleston, Mr. Young requested me
to write a piece for his wife's benefit. You remember her, no doubt;
remarkable as she was for her personal beauty and amiable deportment,
it would have been very ungallant to have refused, particularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span>
as he requested that it should be a "<i>breeches part</i>," to use a green-room
term, though she was equally attractive in every character.
Poor Mrs. Young! she died last year in Philadelphia. When she
first arrived in New-York, from London, it was difficult to conceive
a more perfect beauty; her complexion was of dazzling whiteness,
her golden hair and ruddy complexion, figure somewhat <i>embonpoint</i>,
and graceful carriage, made her a great favourite. I soon produced
the little piece, which was called "Paul and Alexis; or, the Orphans
of the Rhine." I was, at that period, a very active politician, and
my political opponents did me the honour to go to the theatre the
night it was performed, for the purpose of hissing it, which was not
attempted until the curtain fell, and the piece was successful. After
three years' absence in Europe and Africa, I saw the same piece
performed at the Park, under the title of "The Wandering Boys,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
which even now holds possession of the stage. It seems Mr. Young
sent the manuscript to London, where the title was changed, and the
bantling cut up, altered, and considerably improved.</p>

<p>About this time, John Miller, the American bookseller in London,
paid us a visit. Among the passengers in the same ship was a fine
English girl of great talent and promise, Miss Leesugg, afterwards
Mrs. Hackett. She was engaged at the Park as a singer, and Phillips,
who was here about the same period fulfilling a most successful
engagement, was decided and unqualified in his admiration of her
talent. Every one took an interest in her success: she was gay,
kind-hearted, and popular, always in excellent spirits, and always
perfect. Anxious for her success, I ventured to write a play for her
benefit, and in three days finished the patriotic piece of "She Would
be a Soldier; or, the Battle of Chippewa,"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which, I was happy to
find, produced her an excellent house. Mrs. Hackett retired from
the stage after her marriage, and lost six or seven years of profitable
and unrivalled engagement.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>After this play, I became in a manner domiciliated in the green-room.
My friends, Price and Simpson, who had always been exceedingly
kind and liberal, allowed me to stray about the premises
like one of the family, and, always anxious for their success, I ven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>tured
upon another attempt for a holy-day occasion, and produced
"Marion; or, the Hero of Lake George." It was played on the 25th
of November, Evacuation day [1821], and I bustled about among
my military friends, to raise a party in support of a military play,
and what with generals, staff-officers, rank and file, the Park Theatre
was so crammed, that not a word of the play was heard, which was
a very fortunate affair for the author. The managers presented me
with a pair of handsome silver pitchers, which I still retain as a
memento of their good-will and friendly consideration. You must
bear in mind that while I was thus employed in occasional attempts
at play-writing, I was engaged in editing a daily journal, and in all
the fierce contests of political strife: I had, therefore, but little time
to devote to all that study and reflection so essential to the success
of dramatic composition.</p>

<p>My next piece, I believe, was written for the benefit of a relative
and friend, who wanted something to bring a house; and as the
struggle for liberty in Greece was at that period the prevailing excitement,
I finished the melodrama of the <i>Grecian Captive</i>, which was
brought out with all the advantages of good scenery and music
[June 17, 1822]. As a "good house" was of more consequence to
the actor than fame to the author, it was resolved that the hero of
the piece should make his appearance on an elephant, and the
heroine on a camel, which were procured from a neighbouring
<i>menagerie</i>, and the <i>tout ensemble</i> was sufficiently imposing, only it
happened that the huge elephant, in shaking his skin, so rocked the
castle on his back, that the Grecian general nearly lost his balance,
and was in imminent danger of coming down from his "high estate,"
to the infinite merriment of the audience. On this occasion, to use
another significant phrase, a "gag" was hit upon of a new character
altogether. The play was printed, and each auditor was presented
with a copy gratis, as he entered the house. Figure to yourself a
thousand people in a theatre, each with a book of the play in hand&mdash;imagine
the turning over a thousand leaves simultaneously, the buzz
and fluttering it produced, and you will readily believe that the
actors entirely forgot their parts, and even the equanimity of the
elephant and camel were essentially disturbed.</p>

<p>My last appearance, as a dramatic writer, was in another national
piece, called "The Siege of Tripoli," which the managers persuaded
me to bring out for my own benefit, being my first attempt to derive
any profit from dramatic efforts. The piece was elegantly got up&mdash;the
house crowded with beauty and fashion&mdash;everything went off
in the happiest manner; when, a short time after the audience had
retired, the Park Theatre was discovered to be on fire, and in a short
time was a heap of ruins. This conflagration burnt out all my
dramatic fire and energy, since which I have been, as you well know,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>
peaceably employed in settling the affairs of the nations, and mildly
engaged in the political differences and disagreements which are so
fruitful in our great state.</p>

<p>I still, however, retain a warm interest for the success of the
drama, and all who are entitled to success engaged in sustaining it,
and to none greater than to yourself, who have done more, in actual
labour and successful efforts, than any man in America. That you
may realize all you have promised yourself, and all that you are
richly entitled to, is the sincere wish of</p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The following dramatic <i>bagatelle</i> was written in a few days, and
its reception, under every circumstance, far exceeded its merits.
I had no idea of printing it, until urged to do so by some friends
connected with theatres, who, probably, were desirous of using
it without incurring the expense of transcribing from the original
manuscript. Writing plays is not my "vocation;" and even if the
mania was to seize me, I should have to contend with powerful
obstacles, and very stubborn prejudices; to be sure, these, in
time, might be removed, but I have no idea of being the first to
descend into the arena, and become a gladiator for the American
Drama. These prejudices against native productions, however
they may be deplored as impugning native genius, are nevertheless
very natural. An American audience, I have no doubt,
would be highly pleased with an American play, if the performance
afforded as much gratification as a good English one; but
they pay their money to be pleased, and if we cannot afford
pleasure, we have no prescriptive right to ask for approbation.
In England, writing of plays is a profession, by which much
money is made if the plays succeed; hence a dramatic author
goes to work, <i>secundum artem</i>.&mdash;He employs all his faculties, exhausts
all his resources, devotes his whole time, capacity and ingenuity
to the work in hand; the hope of reward stimulates him&mdash;the
love of fame urges him on&mdash;the opposition of rivals animates
his exertions&mdash;and the expectation of applause sweetens
his labours&mdash;and yet, nine times out of ten, he fails. Mr. Dunlap,
of this city, has written volumes of plays, and written well,
"excellent well," but he made nothing; nay, he hardly obtained
that civic wreath which he fairly earned. Barker, of Philadelphia,
whose muse is the most delicate and enticing, has hung
up his harp, which, I dare say, is covered with dust and cobwebs;
and even Harby, of Charleston, whose talents are of the finest
order, and who is a bold yet chaste poet, gained but little profit
and applause from his labours. We must not expect, therefore,
more encouragement for the American Drama than may be sufficient
to urge us on. We will succeed in time, as well as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span>
English, because we have the same language, and equal intellect;
but there must be system and discipline in writing plays&mdash;a
knowledge of stage effect&mdash;of sound, cadences, fitness of time and
place, interest of plot, spirit of delineation, nature, poetry, and a
hundred <i>et ceteras</i>, which are required, to constitute a good dramatic
poet, who cannot, in this country, and while occupied in
other pursuits, spring up over night like asparagus, or be watered
and put in the sun, like a geranium in a flower pot.</p>

<p>I wrote this play in order to promote the benefit of a performer
who possesses talent, and I have no objections to write another
for any deserving object. New plays, in this country, are generally
performed, for the first time, as anonymous productions: I
did not withhold my name from this, because I knew that my
friends would go and see it performed, with the hope of being
pleased, and my opponents would go with other motives, so that
between the two parties a good house would be the result. This
was actually the case, and two performances produced nearly
$2,400; I hope this may encourage Americans of more talent to
attempt something.</p>

<p>National plays should be encouraged. They have done everything
for the British nation, and can do much for us; they keep
alive the recollection of important events, by representing them
in a manner at once natural and alluring. We have a fine scope,
and abundant materials to work with, and a noble country to
justify the attempt. The "Battle of Chippewa" was selected,
because it was the most neat and spirited battle fought during the
late war, and I wish I was able to do it more justice.</p>

<h2>PLAINS OF CHIPPEWA</h2>




<h2 class="gap3"><a name="ACT_I" id="ACT_I"></a>ACT I.</h2>


<p class="hangindent"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> I. <i>A Valley with a neat Cottage on the right, an Arbour on
the left, and picturesque Mountains at a distance.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter from the cottage, <span class="smcap">Jasper</span> and <span class="smcap">Jenkins.</span></i></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jenkins.</span> And so, neighbour, you are not then a native of this
village?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> I am not, my friend; my story is short, and you shall
hear it. It was my luck, call it bad or good, to be born in France,
in the town of Castlenaudary, where my parents, good honest
peasants, cultivated a small farm on the borders of the canal of
Midi. I was useful, though young; we were well enough to live,
and I received from the parish school a good education, was
taught to love my country, my parents, and my friends; a
happy temper, a common advantage in my country, made all
things easy to me; I never looked for to-morrow to bring me more
joy than I experienced to-day.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jenkins.</span> Pardon my curiosity, friend Jasper: how came you
to leave your country, when neither want nor misfortune visited
your humble dwelling?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> Novelty, a desire for change, an ardent disposition to
visit foreign countries. Passing through the streets of Toulouse
one bright morning in spring, the lively drum and fife broke on
my ear, as I was counting my gains from a day's marketing.
A company of soldiers neatly dressed, with white cockades,
passed me with a brisk step; I followed them through instinct&mdash;the
sergeant informed me that they were on their way to Bordeaux,
from thence to embark for America, to aid the cause of
liberty in the new world, and were commanded by the Marquis
de la Fayette. That name was familiar to me; La Fayette was a
patriot&mdash;I felt like a patriot, and joined the ranks immediately.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jenkins.</span> Well, you enlisted and left your country?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> I did. We had a boisterous passage to America, and
endured many hardships during the revolution. I was wounded
at Yorktown, which long disabled me, but what then? I served
under great men, and for a great cause; I saw the independence
of the thirteen states acknowledged, I was promoted to a sergeancy
by the great Washington, and I sheathed my sword, with
the honest pride of knowing, that I had aided in establishing a
powerful and happy republic.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jenkins.</span> You did well, honest Jasper, you did well; and now
you have the satisfaction of seeing your country still free and
happy.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> I have, indeed. When the army was disbanded, I
travelled on foot to explore the uncultivated territory which I had
assisted in liberating. I purchased a piece of land near the great
lakes, and with my axe levelled the mighty oaks, cleared my
meadows, burnt out the wolves and bears, and then built that
cottage there.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jenkins.</span> And thus became a settler and my neighbour; thanks
to the drum and fife and the white cockade, that lured you from
your home.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> In a short time, Jenkins, everything flourished; my
cottage was neat, my cattle thriving, still I wanted something&mdash;it
was a wife. I was tired of a solitary life, and married Kate,
the miller's daughter; you knew her.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jenkins.</span> Ay, that I did; she was a pretty lass.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> She was a good wife&mdash;ever cheerful and industrious,
and made me happy: poor Kate! I was without children for
several years; at length my Christine was born, and I have endeavoured,
in cultivating her mind, and advancing her happiness,
to console myself for the loss of her mother.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jenkins.</span> Where is Christine? where is your daughter, neighbour
Jasper?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> She left the cottage early this morning with Lenox,
to climb the mountains and see the sun rise; it is time for them
to return to breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jenkins.</span> Who is this Mr. Lenox?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> An honest lieutenant of infantry, with a gallant spirit
and a warm heart. He was wounded at Niagara, and one stormy
night, he presented himself at our cottage door, pale and haggard.
His arm had been shattered by a ball, and he had received
a flesh wound from a bayonet: we took him in&mdash;for an old soldier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span>
never closes his door on a wounded comrade&mdash;Christine nursed
him, and he soon recovered. But I wish they were here&mdash;it is
growing late: besides, this is a busy day, friend Jenkins.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jenkins.</span> Ah, how so?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> You know Jerry Mayflower, the wealthy farmer;
he has offered to marry my Christine. Girls must not remain
single if they can get husbands, and I have consented to the
match, and he will be here to-day to claim her hand.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jenkins.</span> But will Christine marry Jerry? She has been too
well educated for the honest farmer.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> Oh, she may make a few wry faces, as she does when
swallowing magnesia, but the dose will go down. There is some
credit due to a wife who improves the intellect of her husband;
aye, and there is some pride in it also. Girls should marry. Matrimony
is like an old oak; age gives durability to the trunk, skill
trims the branches, and affection keeps the foliage ever green.
But come, let us in.</p>

<p class="stagedir">&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i><span class="smcap">Jasper</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>&nbsp;enter&nbsp;the&nbsp;cottage.</i></p>

<p class="hangindent"><i>Pastoral Music.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lenox</span> and <span class="smcap">Christine</span> are seen winding down
the mountains&mdash;his left arm is in a sling.</i></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> At last we are at home.&mdash;O my breath is nearly
gone. You soldiers are so accustomed to marching and countermarching,
that you drag me over hedge and briar, like an empty
baggage-wagon. Look at my arm, young Mars, you've made it as
red as pink, and as rough as&mdash;then my hand&mdash;don't attempt to
kiss it, you&mdash;wild man of the woods.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> Nay, dear Christine, be not offended; if I have passed
rapidly over rocks and mountains, it is because you were with me.
My heart ever feels light and happy when I am permitted to
walk with you; even the air seems newly perfumed, and the
birds chaunt more melodiously; and see, I can take my arm out of
confinement&mdash;your care has done this; your voice administered
comfort, and your eyes affection. What do I not owe you?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> Owe me? Nothing, only one of your best bows,
and your prettiest compliments. But I do suspect, my serious
cavalier, that your wounds were never as bad as you would have
me think. Of late you have taken your recipes with so much
grace, have swallowed so many bitter tinctures with a playful
smile, that I believe you've been playing the invalid, and would
make me your nurse for life&mdash;O sinner as you are, what have you
to say for yourself?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> Why, I confess, dear Christine, that my time has
passed with so much delight, that even the call of duty will find
me reluctant to quit these scenes, so dear to memory, hospitality,
and, let me add, to love. Be serious, then, dear Christine, and tell
me what I have to hope; even now I expect orders from my commanding
officer, requiring my immediate presence at the camp;
we are on the eve of a battle&mdash;Speak!</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> Why, you soldiers are such fickle game, that if we
once entangle you in the net, 'tis ten to one but the sight of a new
face will be sufficiently tempting to break the mesh&mdash;you're just
as true as the smoke of your cannon, and you fly off at the sight
of novelty in petticoats, like one of your Congreve rockets&mdash;No,
I won't love a soldier&mdash;that's certain.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> Nay, where is our reward then for deserving well of
our country? Gratitude may wreath a chaplet of laurel, but
trust me, Christine, it withers unless consecrated by beauty.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> Well, that's a very pretty speech, and deserves
one of my best courtesies. Now suppose I should marry you, my
"dear ally Croaker," I shall expect to see myself placed on the
summit of a baggage-wagon, with soldiers' wives and a few dear
squalling brats, whose musical tones drown e'en the "squeaking
of the wry-neck'd fife;" and if I should escape from the enemy at
the close of a battle, I should be compelled to be ever ready, and
"pack up my tatters and follow the drum."&mdash;No, no, I can't
think of it.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> Prithee, be serious, dear Christine, your gaiety alarms
me. Can you permit me to leave you without a sigh? Can I
depart from that dear cottage and rush to battle without having
the assurance that there is a heart within which beats in unison
with mine? a heart which can participate in my glory, and sympathize
in my misfortunes?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> No&mdash;not so, Lenox; your glory is dear to me, your
happiness my anxious wish. I have seen you bear pain like a soldier,
and misfortune like a man. I am myself a soldier's daughter,
and believe me, when I tell you, that under the appearance of
gaiety, my spirits are deeply depressed at your approaching departure.
I have been taught, by a brave father, to love glory when
combined with virtue. There is my hand;&mdash;be constant, and I
am ever your friend; be true, and you shall find me ever faithful.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> Thanks&mdash;a thousand thanks, beloved Christine; you
have removed a mountain of doubts and anxious wishes from my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span>
heart: I did hope for this reward, though it was a daring one.
Love and honour must now inspire me, and should we again be
triumphant in battle, I shall return to claim the reward of constancy&mdash;a
reward dearer than thrones&mdash;the heart of a lovely and
virtuous woman.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> Enough, dear Lenox; I shall never doubt your
faith. But come, let us in to breakfast&mdash;stay&mdash;my knight of the
rueful countenance, where is the portrait which you have been
sketching of me? Let me look at your progress.</p>

<p class="indent1 befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> 'Tis here.</p>
<p class="stagedir">&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Gives&nbsp;a&nbsp;small&nbsp;drawing&nbsp;book.</i></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> [<i>Opening it.</i>] Heavens, how unlike! Why Lenox,
you were dreaming of the <i>Venus de Medici</i> when you drew this&mdash;Oh,
you flatterer!</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> Nay, 'tis not finished; now stand there, while I sketch
the drapery.&mdash;[<i>Places her at a distance, takes out a pencil, and
works at the drawing.</i>]</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> Why, what a statue you are making of me. Pray,
why not make a picture of it at once? Place me in that bower,
with a lute and a lap dog, sighing for your return; then draw a
soldier disguised as a pilgrim, leaning on his staff, and his cowl
thrown back; let that pilgrim resemble thee, and then let the
little dog bark, and I fainting, and there's a subject for the pencil
and pallet.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> Sing, dear Christine, while I finish the drawing&mdash;it
may be the last time I shall ever hear you.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> Oh, do not say so, my gloomy cavalier; a soldier,
and despair?</p>

of the finest lads in our county, with rifles&mdash;well, we march'd and

rifles, and dashed over?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Oh no, I didn't&mdash;I was afear'd that in such a crowd,
nobody would see how I fought, so I didn't cross at all. Besides,
some one said, it were contrary to law and the constitution, to go
into the enemy's country, but if they com'd into our country, it
were perfectly lawful to flog 'em.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> And you did not cross?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Oh no, I stood still and look'd on; it were contrary to
the constitution of my country, and my own constitution to boot&mdash;so
I took my post out of good gun shot, and felt no more fear
nor you do now.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> No doubt. Admirable sophistry, that can shield
cowards and traitors, under a mistaken principle of civil government!
I've heard of those scruples, which your division felt when
in sight of the enemy. Was that a time to talk of constitutions&mdash;when
part of our gallant army was engaged with unequal numbers?
Could you calmly behold your fellow citizens falling on all
sides, and not avenge their death? Could you, with arms in your
hands, the enemy in view, with the roar of cannon thundering on
your ear, and the flag of your country waving amidst fire and
smoke&mdash;could you find a moment to think of constitutions?
Was that a time to pause and suffer coward scruples to unnerve
the arm of freemen?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Bravo! bravo! sergeant Jasper; that's a very fine
speech&mdash;I'll vote for you for our assemblyman; now just go that
over again, that I may get it by heart for our next town meeting&mdash;blazing
flags&mdash;fiery cannon&mdash;smoking constitutions&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> I pray you pardon me. I am an old soldier, and fought
for the liberty which you enjoy, and, therefore, claim some privilege
in expressing my opinion. But come, your friends are idle,
let us have breakfast before our cottage door.&mdash;Ah, Jerry, my
Crissy would make a fine soldier's wife: do you know that I have
given her a military education?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> No, surely&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> Aye, she can crack a bottle at twelve paces with a
pistol.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Crack a bottle! Come, that's a good one; I can crack
a bottle too, but not so far off.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> And then she can bring down a buck, at any distance.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Bring down a buck? I don't like that&mdash;can't say as
how I like my wife to meddle with bucks. Can she milk&mdash;knit
garters&mdash;make apple butter and maple sugar&mdash;dance a reel after
midnight, and ride behind her husband on a pony, to see the

she comes.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Christine</span> and <span class="smcap">Lenox</span> from the cottage.</i></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> Christine, here is farmer Mayflower and his friends,
who have come to visit our cottage, and you in particular.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> They are all welcome. Good morning, Jerry&mdash;how
is it with you?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Purely, Miss Crissy, I'm stout and hearty, and you

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Why, Miss Crissy, your father has consented that I
shall marry you, and I've come with my neighbours to have a
little frolic, and carry you home with me.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> And am I of so little moment as not to be consulted?
Am I thus to be given away by my father without one
anxious question? [<i>With decision.</i>] Farmer, pardon my frankness;
on this occasion, sincerity alone is required&mdash;I do not like
you, I will not marry you&mdash;nay, do not look surprised. I am a
stranger to falsehood and dissimulation, and thus end at once all
hopes of ever becoming my husband.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Why, now, Miss Crissy, that's very cruel of you&mdash;I
always had a sneaking kindness for you, and when your father
gave his consent, I didn't dream as how you could refuse me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> My father has ever found me dutiful and obedient,
but when he bestows my hand, without knowing whether my
heart or inclinations accompany it, I feel myself bound to consult
my own happiness. I cannot marry you, farmer.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> [<i>Advancing.</i>] All things are prepared, and I am now

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Now, Crissy, don't be so shy&mdash;you know you like me&mdash;you
know you said t' other day, when I were out training, that I
held up my head more like a soger than anybody in the ranks;

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> No, it's quite possible. Farmer, said she, I will <i>not</i>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Objections! Oh, none in the world, only she wouldn't

<p class="center"><i>Enter from the marquee, <span class="smcap">Lenox</span> and <span class="smcap">Adela</span>.</i></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> I never was more surprised! just when I had brush'd
up my arms, and prepared to meet the enemy, who should I find
in camp but you, my old hoyden scholar. Why Adela, you have
grown nearly as tall as a grenadier, and as pretty&mdash;zounds, I
would kiss you, if I dare.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Adela.</span> I am delighted to see you, dear Lenox; you are still
as gay and amiable as when you taught your little Adela to conjugate
verbs, and murder French; I heard of your gallantry and
wounds, and imagined I should see you limping on crutches, with
a green patch over one eye, and a wreath of laurel around your
head, a kind of limping, one-eyed cupid; but I find you recovered
from your wounds, and ready for new ones, my soldier.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> Bravo! the little skipping girl, who was once so full of
mischief, has grown a tall and beautiful woman. But what
brings you to camp, Adela? What have you to do with "guns
and drums? heaven save the mark!"</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Adela.</span> Why, my father wrote for me, expecting that the
campaign was drawing to a close; but scarcely had I arrived
here, when intelligence reached us that the enemy, in force, had
occupied a position near Chippewa; it was too late to return, so I
remained to see a little skirmishing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> And are you prepared to endure the privations of a
camp?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Adela.</span> Oh, it is delightful! it is something out of the common
order of things, something new&mdash;such echoing of bugles&mdash;glistening
of fire-arms, and nodding of plumes&mdash;such marchings and
countermarchings&mdash;and such pretty officers too, Lenox; but
then a terrible accident happened to me the other day.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> Aye, what was it?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Adela.</span> Why you must know, that I accompanied my father,
who with his suite, and a small detachment, went out on a reconnoitering
project.&mdash;Just as we <i>debouched</i> from the wood, according
to the military phrase, we came suddenly and unexpectedly
on a foraging party of the enemy, who began to fight
and retreat at the same time.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> Well?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Adela.</span> My horse happening to be an old trooper, the moment
the bugles sounded, and he heard the prattle of the small arms,
he dashed in amongst them, and there was I screaming in a most
delightful style, which, by some, must have been mistaken for a
war-whoop, and to mend the matter, a very polite and accomplished
Indian took aim at me with his rifle, and actually shot
away the plume from my hat, which, I dare say, was as valuable
a prize to him as I should have been.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> And how did you escape from your perilous situation?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Adela.</span> Oh, I soon recovered my fright, and reined in my old
horse; my father and a few soldiers cut in before me, and covered
my retreat, so that in the conclusion of this little affair, I gained
a feather in my cap, though the enemy carried off the plume;
and I found myself at last on the field of battle, as cool as any
hero in the army.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> And so, my lively Adela, you have been fairly introduced
to Mars and Bellona; how do you like them?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Adela.</span> Prodigiously. I find, after all, that courage is something
like a cold bath; take the first plunge, and all is over. Lord,
Lenox, how delightful it would have been, had I been armed and
fought gallantly in that affair; my name would have been immortalized
like Joan of Arc's. Congress would have voted me a
medal, I should have had a public dinner at Tammany-Hall, and
his honour the mayor would have made me one of his prettiest
speeches, in presenting me with the freedom of the great city in a
gold box.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> And so, then, you admire a military life?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Adela.</span> Oh, I'm in raptures with it! I am a perfect female
Quixote, and would relinquish a thousand dandy beaux for one
brave fellow; and, therefore, Lenox, don't be surprised, if you
should see me going about from tent to tent, chaunting the old

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Pendragon.</span> Who am I? Why, sir, I am the honourable captain
Pendragon, of his majesty's guards, formerly of the buffs.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Indian.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] The officer who is to be under my command.
Well sir, you have lately arrived from across the great
waters: How did you leave my father, the King of England?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Pendragon.</span> How! call my most gracious sovereign your
father? Why, sir, you are the most familiar&mdash;impertinent&mdash;'sdeath!
I shall choke&mdash;What the devil do you mean?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Indian.</span> [<i>Coolly.</i>] What should I mean, young man, but to
inquire after the health of my father, who commands my respect,
who has honoured me with his favours, and in whose cause
I am now fighting.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Pendragon.</span> Well, sir, if you have the honour to hold a commission
from his majesty, I desire that you will speak of him with
proper awe, and not call him your father, but your gracious
master.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Indian.</span> Young man, the Indian warrior knows no master
but the Great Spirit, whose voice is heard in thunder, and whose
eye is seen in the lightning's flash; free as air, we bow the knee to
no man; our forests are our home, our defence is our arms, our
sustenance the deer and the elk, which we run down. White men
encroach upon our borders, and drive us into war; we raise the
tomahawk against your enemies, because your king has promised
us protection and supplies. We fight for freedom, and in that
cause, the great king and the poor Indian start upon equal terms.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Pendragon.</span> A very clever spoken fellow, pon honour; I'll
patronise him.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Pendragon.</span> And are you prepared to fan these Yankees?
We shall flog them without much fatigue, I understand.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Indian.</span> Not so fast, young soldier; these pale-faced enemies
of ours fight with obstinacy; accustomed to a hardy life, to
liberty and laws, they are not willing to relinquish those blessings
on easy terms; if we conquer them, it must be by no moderate
exertions: it will demand force and cunning.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Pendragon.</span> Oh, dry dogs, I suppose, not to be caught napping;
well, I'm up to them, we'll fan them in high style; the
ragged nabobs, I understand, are not far off, and our troops are
in fine preservation.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Indian.</span> True, preparation must be made to meet them.
You are under my orders.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Pendragon.</span> The devil I am!</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Indian.</span> Aye, sir; your general, at my request, has ordered you
here to take command of a company of my warriors; but you
must not appear in that dress: change it quickly, or they will not
be commanded by you; they are men, and fight under the orders
of men.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Pendragon.</span> Change my dress! why what the devil do you
mean, sir?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Indian.</span> Mean? that you should appear in the ranks like
a warrior, and not like a rabbit trussed for dressing&mdash;off with
these garments, which give neither pleasure to the eye nor ease to
the limbs&mdash;put on moccasins, wrap a blanket around you, put
rings through your nose and ears, feathers in your head, and
paint yourself like a soldier, with vermilion.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Pendragon.</span> Why, this is the most impertinent and presuming
savage in the wilds of North America. Harkee, sir, I'd have you
to know, that I am a man of fashion, and one of the fancy&mdash;formerly
of the buffs, nephew of a peer of the realm, and will be a
member of parliament, in time; an officer of great merit and great
services, Mr.&mdash;Red Jacket. Paint my face, and fight without
clothes? I desire, sir, that you will please to take notice, that I
fought at Badahoz with the immortal Wellington, and had the
honour to be wounded, and promoted, and had a medal for my
services in that affair, Mr.&mdash;Split-log. Put rings in my nose?
a man of taste, and the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of Bond-street, the very
mirror of fashion and elegance? Sir, I beg you to observe, that
I am not to be treated in this manner&mdash;I shall resent this insult.
Damme, I shall report you to the commander-in-chief at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</a></span>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> I can't say, but her father and a whole <i>posse comitatus</i>,

when I came here, I found some of my old comrades who fought
with me at Queenstown; and so having a little money, we went
to take a comfortable pitcher of whiskey punch together, and so,
while over our cups, they doubted my valour, and hinted that I
run away before the battle.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jailor.</span> Well, and what did you do?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Why, I offered to fight 'em single-handed all round,

they tweaked my nose, boxed my ears, and kick'd me out of the

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">General.</span> At length victory has crown'd our arms, and the
result of this action will keep alive the spirits of our troops, and
the hopes of our country. Hark! the bugles are sounding a retreat,
and the enemy has abandoned the field and taken to his entrenchments.
Lenox, your hand&mdash;your conduct this day has confirmed
our hopes&mdash;allow me in the name of our country to thank
you.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> Not a word, dear general, not a word; I have merely
done my duty, and done no more than every soldier in our ranks.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">General.</span> What is the result of this day's action?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> The enemy has lost upwards of 500 in killed and
wounded, and several principal officers have been taken prisoners.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">General.</span> In what position were they when the attack became
general?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> The British commander, pressed by our artillery
under Towson, issued in all his force from his entrenchments.
It was a gallant sight, to see his solid columns and burnished arms
advance on the margin of the river, and his cavalry, with lightning's
force, dart on our flanks to turn and throw them into confusion:
but they were met by the volunteers under the brave
Porter, and gallantly repulsed.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">General.</span> Go on.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> The enemy then condensed his forces and crossed the
bridge, and was encountered on the plains of Chippewa by Scott,
with his brigade, when the action became severe and general.
No ambuscade or masked batteries were held in reserve&mdash;the
enemy was not a moment concealed from our view&mdash;no tangled
thicket or umbrageous groves gave effect or facility to our rifles:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[Pg 670]</a></span>
the battle was fought on a plain&mdash;where man grappled man,
force was opposed to force, skill to skill, and eye to eye, in regular,
disciplined, and admirable order.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">General.</span> How near were you to the British general?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> In sight and hearing. Charge the Yankees! said a
hoarse voice which I knew to be his. Charge away! said our ardent
troops, as they advanced with fixed bayonets; the fire became
dreadful, and our stars and stripes were seen waving in the
blaze. Scott rode through the lines cheering the men, and gallantly
leading them on; Jessup and his third battalion turned
the right flank of the enemy after a dreadful conflict; Ketchum
had kept up a cross and ruinous fire; and Towson, from his
dread artillery, scattered grape like hail amongst them. On, on!
cried Leavenworth, the day's our own, my boys! Just then a
shot struck down my comrade, Harrison, and shattered his leg.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">General.</span> Well?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> He grasped his sword and fought on his stump, clinging
to the spot like fire-eyed Mars; the enemy, pressed on all
sides, gave way; our troops pursued, and the flight became general.
At length we drove them to their entrenchments, and remained
masters of the field. Our trumpets sounded their retreat;
victory perched on our eagles, and our bands struck up the soul-inspiring
air of "Hail, Columbia, happy land!"</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">General.</span> Well done, my brave fellows! This action will
teach the enemy to respect that valour which they cannot subdue.
See that the wounded prisoners are taken care of: give them all
succor: victory loses half its value, when it is not tempered with
mercy.</p>

cherished and protected you; but when your numbers increased,
you rose like wolves upon us, fired our dwellings, drove

I was the chief of a great and daring tribe, which smiled on death
with indifference and contempt; my cabin was the seat of hospitality

my prosperity increased, my prospects brightened; but the white

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">General.</span> What has been done, was the result of war.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Indian.</span> Wherefore wage war against us? Was not your territory
sufficiently ample, but did you sigh for our possessions?
Were you not satisfied with taking our land from us, but would
you hunt the lords of the soil into the den of the otter? Why drive
to desperation a free and liberal people? Think you I would be
your enemy unless urged by powerful wrongs? No, white man,
no! the Great Spirit whom we worship, is also the God whom you
adore; for friends we cheerfully lay down our lives; but against
foes, our lives are staked with desperation. Had I taken you
prisoner, death should have been your portion; death in cruel
torments. Then why spare me? why spare the man whose knife
was whetted against your life?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">General.</span> To show, by contrast, the difference of our principles.
You would strike down the captive who implores your

himself for death.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">General.</span> Admirably concluded. And you, sir, what can we
do to lighten your captivity?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Pendragon.</span> Why sir, if war was not my profession, I'd sell
out; but it's always my maxim to obey orders, whatever they
may be: therefore, shall be happy to have a brush with you in
war, and equally happy to crack a bottle of Burgundy with you
in peace; a flash in the pan in one way, or a puff from a segar in
another; a bullet under the ribs in battle, or a country dance in a
ball-room; all's one to me, if it's only fashionably conducted.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">General.</span> Well, let's into my tent and partake of some refreshment.
We may not always meet as enemies.</p>

<p class="center gap2"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> II. <i>A Prison.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i><span class="smcap">Christine</span> seated on a bench; her appearance betrays grief and
despair.</i></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> At length the weary night has passed away, and
day dawns, but brings no joy or comfort to my aching heart.
Alas! alas! Christine, where are all the bright visions thy fond
fancy painted? where is that content and love which gleamed
through the casement of our cottage, when my dear father smiled
on his child, and entwined around her his protecting arms: when
the false Lenox, too, with honeyed lips, and tones soft as zephyrs,
vow'd eternal love? Let me not think of them, or I shall go mad.
Oh, what a contrast! pent up in a vile prison, and in disguise!
condemned to die, and perishing unknown and unprotected.
On the one side, my grave yawns for me; and on the other, a
false lover, and a cruel father, drive me to despair. My brain is
on fire! [<i>Hurries about with rapid strides. Music loud and violent.</i>]
Ha! what is this? [<i>Tears the miniature from around her neck.</i>]
Lenox, these are thy features! thy mild looks beam hope and joy
upon me. [<i>Kisses it.</i>] Could such a face be false? Away with
it! even now he weds another. [<i>Throws the miniature indignantly
from her.</i>] So, 'tis gone, and I am left alone in darkness and
despair. [<i>She stands transfixed with grief&mdash;muffled drum rolls&mdash;she
starts.</i>] Ha! they come for me! Be firm, my heart!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter an <span class="smcap">Officer</span> and a file of <span class="smcap">Soldiers</span>.</i></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Young man, your hour has arrived; the detachment
waits without to receive you.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> [<i>Faintly.</i>] I am ready.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Can I serve you in any manner? Is there no letter&mdash;no
remembrance that you would wish sent to father or friend?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> Oh, forbear!</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Soldier.</span> [<i>Picking up the miniature.</i>] See, sir, here is a miniature.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> [<i>Examining it.</i>] By Heavens, they are the features
of Captain Lenox! How came you by this? What! a thief too?
'Tis well your career is cut short.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> Oh no, no! Give it me, I implore you; 'tis mine.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> I shall restore it to the rightful owner. Come, we wait.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> Lead on. A few fleeting moments, and all my
troubles will be at an end.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> He has not, but admits the crime.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">General.</span> [<i>Returning papers.</i>] 'Tis well&mdash;see him executed

open, drums roll, and the procession enters for the execution of
<span class="smcap">Christine</span>; she is in the centre, between the two detachments;
her coat is off, and the stock unloosened from her neck&mdash;her step is
firm, until she reaches the tent of <span class="smcap">Lenox</span>, when she clasps her
hands and hangs down her head in despair. Procession makes
the circuit of the stage with slow steps, and when opposite the tent
she kneels; an <span class="smcap">Officer</span> places the bandage over her eyes, and gives
a sign to a detachment of four to advance; they step forward, and
level their muskets at her; at the moment, <span class="smcap">Lenox</span> rushes from the
tent with the miniature in his hand and strikes up their guns.</i></p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> Hold! for your lives! [<i>Rushes down to <span class="smcap">Christine</span>,

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> Not married? not your betrothed? O Lenox, are
you then faithful?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Lenox.</span> Could Christine doubt my vows?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> I see it all&mdash;I have been deceived. Pardon me,
dear Lenox; but driven to despair by your supposed perfidy, I enlisted,
and rushed on my fate&mdash;which in a moment (horrid
thought!) would have terminated. But you are true, and I am
happy.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Christine.</span> My sufferings have been equally severe; but do
you pardon your child?</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jasper.</span> I do&mdash;I do! and further prove my love, by making you
happy. Take her, Lenox, she is yours; and never let father attempt
to force his child into a marriage which her heart abhors.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">Jerry.</span> Well, I vow, Miss Crissy, you look very pretty in pantaloons,
and make a fine soger; but after all, I'm glad to have
escaped a wife who wears the breeches before marriage&mdash;so I
consent that you shall have the infantry ossifer, because I can't
help it; and so I'll marry Patty, the weaver's daughter, though
she can't crack a bottle nor bring down a buck.</p>

<p class="indent1"><span class="smcap">General.</span> All things have terminated happily. Our arms
have been triumphant, and our gallant soldiers rewarded with the
approbation of their country. Love has intwined a wreath for
your brows, Lenox, and domestic peace and happiness await you;
and when old age draws on apace, may you remember the
<span class="smcap">Plains of Chippewa</span>, and feel towards Britain as freemen
should feel towards all the world: "<i>Enemies in war&mdash;in peace,
